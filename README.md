# Cancer-Detection-Using-Hybrid-Model
This project detects lung cancer using a hybrid model combining Faster R-CNN for nodule detection and machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Linear and Logistic Regression for classification. The approach enhances early diagnosis accuracy using both deep learning and traditional ML techniques.
